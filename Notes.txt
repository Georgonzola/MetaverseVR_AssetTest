WASD to move, left click toggles cursor lock

When running in Unity, LoadScene needs to be loaded first or alongside GameScene as it contains data relevant to game completion and player control
This is not an issue in the build as load scene is always run first

Line 19 in BezierVisualiser.cs needs to be commented out before building as Handles causes an error on build
The Handles tool is still useful in Unity when editing beziers so it hasn't been removed completely

Collision on the Sunseekers is inaccurate as I had to use a box collider opposed to a mesh collider for the sunseekers as adding the mesh collider on the child which contains the 3d model caused issues with the collider not triggering.
I couldn't use the mesh collider on the parent object as it showed up smaller and at a vertical angle. 

Plane mesh waves should ideally be done on a text-based compute shader to save further hassle as the visual shader graph is difficult to organise and update.
(for example if a new wave type was implemented all the nodes would have to be adjusted instead of a few lines of code)
Unfortunately I did not have the time to learn how to implement these properly.

Reflections on the water are inaccurate but are still kept in for visual effect

Player boat could do with a depth mask to cut out the water clipping into the boat
